# Week 2 Day 1

We're kicking off this week with more projects! Now that we are in the second week, you'll have less
explicit project instructions in the READMEs, starting in today's second project. Don't worry
though! You'll still have the full video walkthrough if you need help figuring out how to implement
these layouts.
