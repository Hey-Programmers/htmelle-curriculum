# Week 3 Day 1

Welcome to capstone project week! Over the past two weeks you've learned how to make amazing layouts
using HTML and CSS. Now it's time for you to create your very own startup website! Your website
should look good on desktop screens as well as mobile screens.

You won't have any hard instructions to do this. Your goal is design and implement a website that
you are proud of. Feel free to reference the different layouts you made in weeks 1 and 2 if you need
inspiration. Also, check out your favorite websites to borrow designs from. Alvin's favorites are
Instagram, AirBnb, and Twitter.

Get creative! Your startup website can be fictional so just have fun with it. Alvin will be making
"AirbnBark", a website where you can find dogsitters.

## Required sections

Your website must have the following sections:

- Header
- Hero
- Mission
- Features
- Team
- Testimonials
- FAQ
- Footer
- Contact form

You'll have time to work on these sections during each day of studio time this week.

## Starter code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/638d441c12.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <title>capstone project</title>
    <script>
      tailwind.config = {
        theme: {
          extend: {
            fontFamily: {},
          },
        },
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Picking a theme

- [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [tailwindcss colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
- [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/)

Throughout the course you've been using fontawesome for icons and tailwindcss for colors. Since you
are designing your own site. You should think of what icons you'll need for fontawesome; they should
be relevant for your website! Likewise decide on a color palette to use for your site. For example,
Alvin chose orange and blue as his main accent colors. You should also decide on what shade of gray
to stick to throughout the design.

Since this is **your** website, we'll walkthrough how you can pick and configure your own fonts to
use from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):
