# Rent-a-room Project

In this project, we'll create a layout for displaying information about a place that someone can
rent out. The layout will be somewhat inspired by [airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/). The final
product for our page looks like this:

![complete](./images/complete.png)

Create a identical layout! You may change only the image, colors, text, and icons.

You've already used all the tools you need to create this design.  We want **you** to drive this. For
this project, try to code this one up and only use the video walkthrough if you get stuck!

Choose your own colors from [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) and icons
from [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

## Starter code

Use this starter code. We've given you two fonts, `font-rubik` and `font-open`.
