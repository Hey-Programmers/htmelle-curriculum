# Week 3 Day 1

Welcome to capstone project week! Over the past two weeks you've learned how to make amazing layouts
using HTML and CSS. Now it's time for you to create your very own startup website!

You won't have any hard instructions to do this. Your goal is design and implement a website that
you are proud of. Feel free to reference the different layouts you made in weeks 1 and 2 if you need
inspiration. Also, check out your favorite websites to borrow designs from. Alvin's favorites are
Instagram, AirBnb, and Twitter.

Get creative! Your startup website can be fictional so just have fun with it. Alvin will be making
"AirbnBark", a website where you can find dogsitters.

## Required sections

Your website must have the following sections:

- Header
- Hero
- Mission
- Features
- Team
- Testimonials
- FAQ
- Footer
- Contact form

You'll have time to work on these sections during studio time this week.
