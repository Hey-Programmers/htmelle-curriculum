# Optional Projects 3

We're kicking off this week with more projects! Now that we are in the second week, you'll have less
explicit project instructions in the READMEs, starting in today's second project. Don't worry
though! You'll still have the full video walkthrough if you need help figuring out how to implement
these layouts.

Today we learn about how to implement layouts that look good on both mobile and desktop screen sizes. You'll be able to use everything you learned thus far to implement responsive layouts. We only need to introduce one new concept.
